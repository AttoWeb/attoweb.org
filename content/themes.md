# Markdown Themes

## Overview
Styling is pretty much roll your own. Part of the plugin system is a css file for anything special
relating to that plugin. While there are various _flavors_ of Markdown, most adhere to a fairly
consistent set of [standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown#Standardization). As a result,
one can fairly confidently use some of the themes that have been created for various Markdown
flavors.

## Github
The theme used by GitHub for code view, gists, and wikis has got to be the most familiar. It's hard to
track down the _actual_ css used by github, however, many have published various reproductions.

I believe the very closest (perhaps exact) is maintained by [Sindre Sorhus](http://qr.ae/TU16TL).

## Marked
[Marked 2](http://marked2app.com/) is an iOS app for rendering markdown. [Markedstyle](http://markedstyle.com/)
is a curated list of themes for that application that can be used anywhere Markdown is used.
It includes a GitHub theme clone.
